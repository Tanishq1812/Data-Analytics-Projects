# Data Analytics Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio on GitHub! This repository contains a variety of projects where I apply various data analysis algorithms to solve real-world problems. Each project folder includes relevant datasets in CSV format, R scripts detailing the analysis, and a README explaining the project's context and findings.
## Technology Used
* R
* MS SQL Server
* Tableau
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest
* Packages for modelling: dplyr, tidymodels, car, ggplot2, pRoc, randomforest
  
Feel free to explore the projects and reach out if you have questions or would like to collaborate!

Enjoy exploring my projects, and I appreciate any feedback or contributions to improve my work!

**Note**: I have often used a function createDummies, given by our instructor during the course, to create dummies out of character columns. This function can take a threshold frequncy value below which an observation won't get it's own dummy. I usually keep the threshold as 2% of total number of rows. You can find it's R script above. Another package [fastDummies](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fastDummies/index.html) available on CRAN works great too but does't take threshold frequency as an input, as a result you might end up with loads of new dummies corresponding to observations that rarely occur in a column.
